# Komodo
My first game, originally created as a test project, and still is.
The objective of the game is to kill a komodo dragon, by making a trap for it using blocks. You can randomly find chests scattered around the desert, which contain useful tools.

P.S. It is currently impossible to kill the dragon, so just stay away from it. It doesn't even look like a dragon lol.
